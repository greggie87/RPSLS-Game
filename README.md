# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Web Game

[-> Link to live site here <-](https://greggie87.github.io/RPSLS-Game/)

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a great adaptation of the classic game 'Rock Paper Scissors'. The game helps people to make descisions but with extra variables giving a much more random result. People who are friendly with each other are likely to draw when playing rock paper scissors. This version of the game is played against the computer. The computer always picks at random so the results are infinitely variable.

The site is targetted at people of all ages and will help the user to understand the rules of the game as well as helping with potentially important descision making.
